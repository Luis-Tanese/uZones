## Overview

**uZones** is an advanced zoning script that allows users to define and manage zones and nodes through a JSON configuration. Users can create, remove, and interact with zones and nodes using in-game commands. Additionally, uZones supports visualizing nodes, teleporting to specific nodes, and saving the state in a JSON file, making it easy to persist changes across game sessions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Zone & Node Management:** Add, remove, and edit zones and nodes with ease.
- **Node Visualization:** Visualize nodes with barricades for clear representation.
- **Teleportation Support:** Teleport to specific nodes within a zone.
- **Easy Configuration:** All settings and zones are stored in a user-defined JSON configuration file.
- **Command-Based Control:** Simple commands for managing zones and nodes.

Before using **uZones**, ensure you have the following module installed:

- [uScriptExtended v1.6.8.0](https://github.com/MolyiEZ/uScriptExtended/releases/tag/v1.6.8.0) by MolyiEZ
